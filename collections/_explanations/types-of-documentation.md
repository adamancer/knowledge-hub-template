The Divio Documentation System defines four main types of documentation:

- **Tutorials** help readers learn how to use a system
- **How To Guides** show readers how to accomplish a specific task
- **Explanations** help readers understanding a part of the system
- **Reference Guides** provide technical documentation about functions, classes, and fields used by the system
